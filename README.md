# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a project to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on their medical attributes. The project leverages machine learning techniques to provide accurate and efficient predictions.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Predict whether a patient is diabetic based on health parameters like glucose levels, BMI, age, etc.
- Provide insights into the significant factors contributing to diabetes.

## Dataset

- **Source:** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Description:** The dataset includes medical records with the following attributes:
  - Glucose Level
  - Blood Pressure
  - Body Mass Index (BMI)
  - Age
  - Insulin Levels
  - And more...

## Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values.
   - Scaled features using StandardScaler.
   - Split data into training and test sets.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Algorithms used:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Support Vector Machine
     - KNN
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

3. **Results:**
   - The best model achieved an accuracy of **85%**.
   - Feature importance analysis highlighted significant predictors.
